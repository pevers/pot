Peter's Whatsapp Bot

## How to use?
Put your Whatsapp invite link in `index.js` and then run `npm install && npm start`

## TODO
1. Make QR code scan easy. Constantly stream a screenshot page to express!!

## Ideas
1. Word graph
2. Word count with warnings for the last place
3. Filter out spam (more than x characters in message)
4. Talk back by reading constantly and responding to 'x'
5. auto-kick for a unanimous vote
6. Bot should be ready for Github, so no special stuff for the first version
